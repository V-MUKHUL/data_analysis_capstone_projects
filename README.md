# timeSeries_temp_dataset_DMT
Data analysis on daily temperature dataset.

About the dataset: input .csv file consists of 6 columns with date, minimium temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature, Sunrise and sunset time in int format eg: (657 i.e 6:57AM or 1756 as 17:56PM) in 24 hour format.
Timse series dataset ranges from 2014-01-01 to 2018-12-30. Using pandas we are going the predict the temperature for subset of data using ARIMA.
ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, which is widely used for time series dataset. 
Let's begin to see how this works..!!!
